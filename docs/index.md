# Windows XP WIM documentation

Windows XP is known for being slow at installing, and its image format (i386) leaves a lot to be desired.

This is what WIM, a newer image format introduced in Milestone 7 builds of Windows Vista, strives to fix. Although only Windows Vista and above support WIM, some people (me included) have found ways to repack Windows XP to the WIM image format.

Some Windows XP editions (Windows Fundamentals for Legacy PCs and Windows Embedded Standard/POSReady 2009) have a WIM-based installation engine, which we will try our best to reverse engineer and document.
